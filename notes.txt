FAQ

Why is all property public?

- It is a testing library, advanced users should be able
  to use every aspect of the environment.
- Even tho all the method mapping can be stored in a single
  file, its easier to split them apart.

Any plans to implement the not implemented methods?

No. They are excluded because they are more related to setting up
the bot (or bot server) rather than to the functionalities of the
bot. Here is the list of excluded methods if you're interested:
- close
- logOut
- setWebhook
- getWebhookInfo
- deleteWebhook
- getUpdates 

TODO

- Validate types of payload.
- Ping @Aquathing for help in validating.
- Dummy user/chat generator with names.
